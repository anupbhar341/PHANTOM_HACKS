        <p>
          Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31 and noted for its pagan
          and religious roots and secular traditions. In much of Europe and most
          of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious,
          celebrated with parties, spooky costumes, jack-o'-lanterns, pumpkin
          carvings, and the giving of candy. But the holiday also marks the
          beginning of Allhallotide, a three-day Christian triduum dedicated to
          remembering the dead that begins with Halloween (October 31) and is
          followed by All Saints' Day (November 1) and All Souls' Day (November
          2).

        <h2>üëª History Behind The Halloween Night üëª</h2>

        <h3>üéÉ Christian Origins and Historic Customs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Origins:</strong> Halloween has roots in Christian practices
            and pagan customs. The term ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù is derived from ‚ÄúAll
            Hallows' Eve,‚Äù the night before All Saints' Day (1 November) and All
            Souls' Day (2 November), collectively called Allhallowtide.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Early Traditions:</strong> Major feasts like All Hallows'
            had vigils the night before. Pope Gregory III established the feast
            of All Saints in the 8th century, and by 835, the 1st of November
            became the official date in the Frankish Empire.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Customs:</strong> In the Middle Ages, people dressed as
            saints or spirits to avoid recognition by wandering souls. The
            custom of "souling" involved going door-to-door collecting soul
            cakes in exchange for prayers.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Later Observances:</strong> Halloween saw changes during the
            Reformation, with Protestant beliefs clashing with Catholic
            traditions. By the 19th century, customs included lighting candles
            at graves and leaving food for wandering souls.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> Many customs, such as wearing
            costumes, carving jack-o'-lanterns, and lighting candles, evolved
            but remain tied to honoring the dead and protecting the living from
            spirits.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üéÉ Gaelic Folk Influence</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Celtic Origins:</strong> Halloween customs are tied to the
            Gaelic festival of Samhain, marking the end of harvest and the start
            of winter, a time when the boundary between this world and the
            Otherworld thinned.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Pagan and Christian Blending:</strong> Offerings of food and
            drink were left for spirits and the souls of the dead, believed to
            revisit their homes. These traditions blended with Christian
            beliefs.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Divination and Bonfires:</strong> Samhain involved rituals
            and games that foretold the future. Special bonfires were lit for
            protection and to ward off evil spirits.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Costumes and Guising:</strong> Since the 16th century,
            mumming and guising involved going house-to-house in disguise to
            sing or recite verses in exchange for food.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Pranks and Lanterns:</strong> By the 18th century, playing
            pranks linked to imitating spirits became common. Lanterns carved
            from turnips or pumpkins became known as jack-o'-lanterns.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üéÉ Spread to North America</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Colonial Recognition:</strong> Anglican colonists in the
            southern U.S. and Catholic colonists in Maryland acknowledged All
            Hallows' Eve, while Puritans opposed it.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Irish and Scottish Influence:</strong> Halloween became a
            major holiday in America after Irish and Scottish immigrants brought
            their customs in the 19th century.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Spread Across America:</strong> By the early 20th century,
            Halloween gained acceptance across various social, racial, and
            religious groups in the U.S.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Global Spread:</strong> American Halloween traditions spread
            to Europe and parts of the Far East in the late 20th and early 21st
            centuries due to U.S. cultural influence.
